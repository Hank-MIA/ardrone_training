ROS Package Name: ardrone_color_tracking

Package Description:
    This package enables the drone to follow an object of certain color.
    OpenCV is used to perform image processing, and basic control theory is applied to realize the auto-tracking.
    Video demonstration of the drone and detailed documentation of the code will be added soon.

How to use:
Prerequisite: ROS Kinetic
http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic
    1. With a real drone (Parrot AR.drone):
        a) Install ardrone_autonomy package
            http://wiki.ros.org/ardrone_autonomy
        b) Install this package
            Clone this repository to your catkin workspace/src
            In your catkin workspace, use command catkin_make
        c) To launch, connect your wifi to Ardrone, and use following launch command in your terminal:
            roslaunch ardrone_color_tracking keyboard_controller.launch

    2. With Gazebo simulation:
        a) Install modified tum_simulator
            (Has not yet been published on Github, will update soon. Or you can modify the original test world)
        b) launch roscore and the simulator in different terminals
            roscore
            roslaunch cvg_sim_gazebo ardrone_testword.launch
        c) In another terminal, run keyboard_controller.py
            rosrun ardrone_color_tracking keyboard_controller.py

Update:
Mar/19/2019 Color-Tracking works well in simulation.

Acknowledgement:
This package is an extension of ardrone_tutorial package (https://github.com/mikehamer/ardrone_tutorials).
The ardrone_tutorial package provided a frame work for keyboard control and GUI of the drone.
